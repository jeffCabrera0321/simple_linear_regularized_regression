## Introduction


In supervised learning problems, statistical models are developed from a dataset with multiple features. Machine learning programs predict an output from the input dataset by learning from pairs of labeled inputs and outputs; that is, the program learns from examples of the right answers. Supervised learning involves modeling the relationship between measured features of the data and some label associated with the data. Once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data for which the labels are unknown.

* **Regression** tasks, where labels are continuous quantities.

This project focuses on regression tasks using techniques such as simple linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, and principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of multiple regression techniques and preprocessing methods to analyze and model relationships between variables. By leveraging tools like PCA, ridge regression, and lasso regression, it highlights the importance of feature engineering and regularization in building robust predictive models.
